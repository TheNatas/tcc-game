# How to Play

A song starts as soon as the game begins. On screen, seven vertical lanes represent the seven scale degrees of the song’s key. Your character must stand on the lane that corresponds to the chord currently playing.

## Objective
- Match the character’s position to the correct scale degree for each chord in the song.

## Starting Reference
- The first chord is always the tonic (1), the 1st degree.
- The character always starts on degree 1 for reference.

## How It Works
1. Listen: As the song plays, chords change over time.
2. Identify: Each chord corresponds to a scale degree.
3. Move: Shift the character up or down to the lane that matches the current chord’s degree.
4. Hold: Stay on the correct lane until the chord changes again, then adjust as needed.

## Movement
- Move the character up or down using the game’s configured controls (up/down keys).
- You can jump multiple lanes if the chord change skips degrees.

## Tips
- Use the first chord (tonic) as your pitch reference.
- Think in relative degrees: if you hear a move from I to V, move from lane 1 to lane 5.

## Notes
- There is one correct lane per chord at any moment.
- The character’s initial position (degree 1) helps you anchor to the key.
